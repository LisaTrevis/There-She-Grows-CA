			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I started my first landscaping business in 2007 after losing my desk job in the market crash. During the next five years, I dove into the Green Industry acquiring as much working knowledge as I could and completed a degree in Business Management/Accounting. In 2012 I sold the business enabling me to go back to school full-time.<br><br>

				While in school for Environmental Management in Agriculture and Natural Resources, I traveled to multiple states taking short courses and volunteering at Growing Power in WI, Colorado Aquaponics in CO, Women's Environmental Institute in MN, and the Water Management District in FL.<br><br>

				In 2015, I relocated to California to convert grass-covered lawns into beautiful native bee and butterfly habitats and pathways. I also encourage my clients to plant edibles to reduce food transportation costs and to donate their surplus to those less fortunate. "There She Grows CA" went live in March of 2016 and already has a growing client base.<br><br>

				I'm currently interning with the NRCS and the Alameda County Natural Resources District by planting pollinator friendly hedgerows between organic farms and educating the public about water pollution and conservation.<br><br>

				Wwithout clean water, we would not be able to grow food and without pollinators, food production would be drastically reduced. My focus is to utilize every piece of land possible to provide food for pollinating insects, native species for restoration, and to teach others about the importance in protecting our water supply and natural resources.<br><br>

			<h2>About There She Grows CA</h2>
			<p>
				There She Grows CA is a fine gardening company specializing in native and drought tolerant plants, edible gardens, and aquaponics. Iâ€™ve been planning this business since I sold the first landscaping company in 2012 and wanted to concentrate emphasis on restorative practices and giving back to the community.<br><br>

				I focus on residential properties with grass lawns. Initial design, cleanup, and long-term consultations hold the majority of the work. My focus however, is to enable the homeowner to have a low maintenance landscape that can regenerate itself year after year. By leaving a property with minor upkeep allows me to continue transforming other neighboring properties.<br><br>

				Some of my proudest moments are hearing my clients tell others about specific information they've learned from me. One such instance was one neighbor telling another about a small leaf-mining insect on her citrus plant. The insect simply passes through with a short life cycle so instead of spraying pesticide she allowed the minor imperfections and trimmed the damaged leaves after the insect had completed its transition. These are little successes that leave a lasting impression of shared knowledge and a growing love of nature for all those that inhabit the Earth.
